- Use the format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`.
- Types include: feat (new feature), fix (bug fix), docs (documentation), style (formatting), refactor (code change), test (adding tests), chore (maintenance).
- Keep the subject line under 72 characters.
- Use the body to explain the "why" behind the changes if necessary.
